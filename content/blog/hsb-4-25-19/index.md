What a pleasant surprise. Thursday was originally thought to be a food truck day, but I find myself at the local workplace cafeteria, Hartford Steam Boiler. Noah was warm to greet with a beautiful display of a Ramp Risotto. The brilliant emerald base was topped with a healthy cut of wild Arctic Char. More ramps and dehydrated skin were used as finishing touches on this exotic weekday meal.
